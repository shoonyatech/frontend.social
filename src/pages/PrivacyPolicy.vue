              In order to give you the best possible experience using Frontend
              Social, we collect information from your interactions with our
              network. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and
              web server logs. We collect this basic information from everybody,
              whether they have an account or not.
            </p>
            <div>
              The information we collect about all visitors to our website
              includes:
              <ul>
                <li>The visitor’s browser type</li>
                <li>Referring site</li>

                  We also collect potentially personally-identifying information

              In order for you to create an account on Frontend Social and use
              our Services, we need to collect and process certain information.
              Depending on your use of the Services, that may include:

                <li>
                  Communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for

                </li>
                <li>
                  Information that you submit on or to Frontend Social in the

                  Social will also request permission to access additional

                  privacy policies and can be managed through your Twitter

                  The email address associated with your GitHub account, if you

            <p>
              We may use User Personal Information with your permission, so we

              Frontend Social uses a variety of third-party services to diagnose

              Some of the content that you see displayed on Frontend Social is
              not hosted by Frontend Social. These “embeds” are hosted by a
              third-party and embedded in Frontend Social. For example: YouTube
              videos, Codepens, Twitter tweets, or GitHub code that appear
              within a Frontend Social post. These files send data to the hosted
              site just as if you were visiting that site directly (for example,
              when you load a Frontend Social post page with a YouTube video
              embedded in it, YouTube receives data about your activity).
              Frontend Social does not control what data third parties collect
              in cases like this, or what they will do with it. Third-party
              embeds on Frontend Social are not covered by this privacy policy;
              they are covered by the privacy policy of the third-party service.

              We use the “visitor action pixels” from Facebook Inc on our
              website. This allows user behavior to be tracked after they have
              been redirected to our website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This
              enables us to measure the effectiveness of Facebook ads. The data
              collected in this way is anonymous to us, i.e. we do not see the
              personal data of individual users. However, this data is stored
              and processed by Facebook, which is why we are informing you,
              based on our knowledge of the situation. Facebook may link this
              information to your Facebook account and also use it for its own
              promotional purposes, in accordance with Facebook’s Data Usage
              Policy. You can object to the collection of your data by Facebook
              pixel, or to the use of your data for the purpose of displaying
